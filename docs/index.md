# lmi - Unified Platform CLI

Welcome to the documentation for **lmi**, a unified command-line interface for interacting with platform services such as OAuth, Accounts, Client Management, and more.

## What is lmi?

`lmi` provides a single, consistent entry point for developers and operators to manage and automate workflows across multiple platform services. It centralizes configuration, authentication, and logging, and supports an extensible plugin architecture for service-specific commands.

- **Simplifies interaction** with platform services
- **Automates authentication** (OAuth flows, token caching/refresh)
- **Centralizes configuration** with clear precedence
- **Extensible** via plugins
- **Scriptable** for automation and CI/CD

Explore the sections in the navigation to get started, configure your environment, and learn how to extend lmi with plugins.
