# lmi CLI Specification: Testing and Quality Standards

## Scope and Rationale

This specification defines the testing requirements and quality standards for the `lmi` CLI core and its plugins. The goal is to ensure reliability, maintainability, and confidence in releases through comprehensive, automated testing and clear quality guidelines.

## Detailed Requirements and Design

### 1. Core Testing Requirements
- The core CLI package must maintain 100% automated test coverage.
- Tests must cover:
  - Configuration loading and precedence logic
  - Authentication and token caching/refresh logic
  - Command parsing and execution
  - Logging and error handling
  - Plugin discovery and integration
- Tests must validate both success and failure/error scenarios.

### 2. Plugin Testing Requirements
- Plugins are responsible for their own testing and quality standards.
- The core CLI does not enforce plugin test coverage but provides guidelines and examples.
- Plugin tests should cover:
  - Command registration and execution
  - Use of provided `CliContext` and authenticated HTTP client
  - Output formatting and error handling

### 3. Test Types and Tools
- Use `pytest` as the primary test runner.
- Use `coverage.py` or equivalent to measure and enforce coverage.
- Include unit, integration, and (where feasible) end-to-end tests.
- Use mocks and fixtures for external dependencies (e.g., HTTP, file system).

### 4. Quality Standards
- Follow PEP 8 and use type hints throughout the codebase.
- Ensure all tests are automated and runnable via a single command (e.g., `pytest`).
- Document test structure and coverage expectations for contributors.
- Provide example tests for plugin developers.

### 5. Continuous Integration
- Integrate tests into CI pipelines to enforce coverage and prevent regressions.
- CI must fail if core coverage drops below 100% or if any test fails.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Organize tests in a `tests/` directory, mirroring the source structure.
- Use descriptive test names and docstrings.
- Regularly review and update tests as features evolve.
